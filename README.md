# Questions for Analysis

1 What gender would most likely show up for the appointment. 

2 What age group would most likely show up for the appointment.

3 Does receiving sms by a certain age group makes a patient to show up or not?
what gender most likey will respond to this?

4 Does receiving a scholarship by a certain age group makes a patient to show up on the appointment day? what gender most likely will respond to this.

5 What is the average mean of age group of patient that received scholarship?

6 Does waiting days determines whether a patient will show up or not

# Conclusion
There is little or no significant difference between the distribution of Age of patients who showed up for the appointment and the patients that did not showed up for the appointment.However there is significant difference in the gender distributions,this shows that female would showed up for the appointment compared to male.

79.8% of patients showed up for the appointment, while 20.2% did not.
Based on this the most 79.9% of patients that showed up are Old and Adult showed.

There is a higher amount of Youth and Adult that received an SMS and did not showed up compared to old people who received an SMS and showed up.

Children and youth are the majority of people who received scholarships.


# Limitations:

The dataset contains incorrect data with negative waiting days values.

There is no much information to draw conclusion from,such as other medical history of the patient and the location distant of patient.

# In general:

Patient showing up during the waiting days is twice more than patient not showing up therefore the longer the waiting days, the greater the possibility of patients not showing up.This means that sending a regular SMS to patients will make them to show up for their appointment date.

There should be more old patients that received scholarship.
